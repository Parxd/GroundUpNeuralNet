# GroundUpNeuralNet

GroundUpNeuralNet is a fast & efficient C++ library for constructing (deep) neural networks. 

This library was built with Eigen 3.4.0 (link) for its powerful vectorization capabilities and GoogleTest (link) for unit testing. 

NOTE: these dependencies come w/ this project in the CMakeLists, no manual linking needed :)

It also comes with a sample data generators to test your network (i.e. sine wave with noise) and a trainer class for easier training.
