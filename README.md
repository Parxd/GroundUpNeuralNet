# GroundUpNeuralNet

GroundUpNeuralNet is a fast & efficient C++ library for constructing (deep) neural networks. 

This library was built with [Eigen 3.4.0](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for its powerful vectorization capabilities and [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing. 

**NOTE:** these dependencies come w/ this project in the CMakeLists, no manual linking needed :)

It also comes with a sample data generators to test your network (i.e. sine wave with noise) and a trainer class for easier training.
